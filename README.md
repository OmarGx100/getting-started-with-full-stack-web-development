# ðŸš€ My First Full-Stack Web Project  

This project is my first step into full-stack development, where I built a simple web app using **vanilla JavaScript** for the frontend (along with **HTML & CSS**) and **Node.js with Express** for the backend.  

## ðŸŒŸ What I Learned  
Through this project, I explored essential concepts such as:  
- **JavaScript basics** â€“ syntax, DOM manipulation, and event handling.  
- **HTML & CSS** â€“ structuring pages and styling with CSS.  
- **Node.js & Express** â€“ setting up a server, handling routes, and serving dynamic content.  
- **EJS** â€“ rendering dynamic HTML content.  
- **Routing** â€“ using query variables and dynamic routes.  
- **Project structure** â€“ organizing files into `public/` (static assets), `views/` (EJS templates), and `routes/` (backend logic).  
- **Package management** â€“ installing and using npm packages.  

This project was a great introduction to full-stack web development, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and improving! ðŸš€
